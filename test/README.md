# Tests

 - `/scanner`    
        **End-to-end test**.
        Contains the automatic unit tests (requires the Qt framework, i.e. QtTest) for the `scanner` class.

 - `/csvcomparer`     
        The `CSVComparer` class is a helper class that compares two CSV files.
        More especially, the **end-to-end test** class (`tst_scanner`) requires this class to compare the actual and expected results.
